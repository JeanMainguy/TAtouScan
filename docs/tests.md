# Tests 

Tests have been implemented to ensure the correctness of TAtouScan. 


## Unit tests 

Unit tests have been implmented in the tests directory using pytest. 


To run the test suit you would need to  have install TAtouScan from the source code.  For that, you can follow installation instructions [here](./installation.md#from-the-source-code-within-a-conda-environnement).


To install pytest in you environement you can run :

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

Next, you can simply run the following at the root of the directory:

```bash
pytest  
```

To get the percentage of coverage of the test suit can be obtain as follow:

```bash
pytest --cov=tatouscan 
```


<!-- ```{note}

Test coverage is updated by a github workflow in the Action Tab. The test coverage report is then deployed on the github-pages and avalaible [here](<link>).
